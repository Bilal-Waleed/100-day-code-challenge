Day 01 of 100 day code challenge 
I'll do these two question in Day 01 

//Question 2: Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to them, like “Hello Asharib, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

//Question 3: Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
